  - `npm init-dev`
  - `npm test`

> In order to debug please add `DEBUG='@bidipass/sdk:*'` when running `npm test`. This feature is using [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package; please refer to it when using.

> Another option to generate dump QR code for an identity in working directory is adding `BIDIPASS_DUMP_QR=1` environment variable when running tests.

> `npm run init` synchronizes network configuration file (`blockchain/truffle.js`), which contains default network setup used by clients. 
> **Be very careful with this as it is being used in production!**
